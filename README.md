### DevOps
- Author: Jed Leas
- My focus has been setting up the instances of the achirtecture designed by Daniel Jackson which included setting up the:
  1. Nginx (Reverse proxy)
  2. K3s
  3. Postgres
  4. RabbitMQ
  5. Nginx (Website hosting)
- As well as setting up all CI/CD workflows to handle 
    1. Automatic testing on push of main branch on each microservices repo
  2. Automatic Deployment onto k3s with zero downtime on compleation of automatic testing so broken code wont make it to deployment
- And Sorting out bug fixes and connections between each microservices to eachother and the databases for both deployment and testings

1. Open Terminal, Clone and open this repository
```Bash
  git clone https://github.com/Team-Tiger1/LocalDeployment

  cd LocalDeployment
```
2. (If not done already) Run the setup script to clone/update microservice repositories for TheLastFork:
```Bash
   .\setup.bat
```

3. Run The following command to run the tests

    .\test-all.bat
```
4. It should take a few minutes to run but if successful you should see 
```Bash
  All tests finished successfully!
```

##  Run Tests (Linux)
